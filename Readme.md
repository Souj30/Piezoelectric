# Piezoelectric Shoe – A Step Toward Self-Powered Wearable Technology

## 📌 Overview

The Piezoelectric Shoe is an innovative prototype that generates electricity from footsteps using piezoelectric sensors embedded in the sole. Every step produces pressure, which is converted into electrical energy and stored in a rechargeable battery. This stored power can be used to charge small wearable devices like fitness trackers, LEDs, or GPS modules. The project demonstrates how motion-based energy harvesting can provide a sustainable and affordable solution to the problem of limited battery life in wearables.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Wearable devices such as smartwatches and health trackers are limited by short battery life and frequent charging requirements. In remote areas, treks, or emergencies, charging may not always be possible. This project addresses the question:
“Can our daily steps be converted into useful electricity?”


---

## 💡 Solution

By integrating piezoelectric sensors into the shoe sole, pressure from footsteps is harvested as electrical energy. A supporting circuit rectifies, boosts, and regulates this energy before safely storing it in a rechargeable battery. This power can then be used for essential low-power devices.

## ⚙ Working Principle

1. Piezoelectric Sensors – Generate AC voltage when pressure is applied.


2. Bridge Rectifier – Converts AC to DC.


3. Boost Converter – Increases low voltage to a usable 5V.


4. TP4056 Module – Safely charges a 3.7V Li-ion battery.


5. Battery Storage – Stores energy for later use.


6. Output – Powers small electronics such as LEDs, step counters, or GPS trackers.
